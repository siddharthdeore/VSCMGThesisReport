\chapter{Hardware in Loop Simulations}
\label{chap:9}
Real time simulations of VSCMG testbed are discussed in this chapter. 
Various investigations are performed on prototype in order to verify control law and tweak the model dynamics, since exact dynamics of commercial off the shelf affordable components used to build the prototype were unknown. However after several experimental tests so that system works properly as per requirements. Test data is recorded in real time and results are exported to Matlab for post processing.
