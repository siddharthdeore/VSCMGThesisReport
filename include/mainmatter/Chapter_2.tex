\chapter{Equation(s) of Motion}
\label{chap:2}
This chapter elaborates selection of reference system, mathematical definition and generalized nonlinear equations of motion of a rigid spacecraft equipped with array of SGCMG units. First inertial and body fixed \ reference frames assigned to individual components and rotation among frames is defined. Right hand rule is followed for representing  rotation of axis in three dimensional space throughout the thesis considering thumb is pointing towards axis of rotation and direction of rotation along curled fingers.Afterwords, inertia property of individual components, their assembly and its derivative is formulated. Later angular momentum of each rotating body is evaluated. Finally, equation of motion is realized for rigid body spacecraft with generic number of SGCMG modules.
