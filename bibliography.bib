	abstract = {An explicit guidance system based on neural networks is proposed.  The steering law is a function of parameters that are set up according to some optimal criterion.  Optimization can be carried out either by semi-analytical approximated methods or by numerical methods.  By optimization a guidance function is defined p = G (X,t) which transforms the current state of the system X into the optimal parameters value p.  In general calculation of p is rather long and involved, and it is not allowed by an on-board computer.Neural networks can fit any nonlinear function with very high accuracy, so the basic idea is to train a neural network in order to fit some tabulated data of the optimal guidance function G.  If the algorithm for finding the optimal function is replaced on-board by the sub-optimal   neural   approximationp = N (X,t), this system can reduce the on-board computer memory storage and the computing loads for the optimal steering program.In this article the neural guidance is described in some detail.  The performances of this guidance system are investigated by application to some test cases.  Even if the neural guidance is sub-optimal, the launcher gets to the final state with very high accuracy in the presence of relatively high disturbances.},

abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks' to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%} winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

As a result, the subject matter includes theory, technology, and systems engineering. The authors combine material on system-level architecture of spacecraft that feature momentum-control systems with material about the momentum-control hardware and software. This also encompasses material on the theoretical and algorithmic approaches to the control of space vehicles with CMGs. In essence, CMGs are the attitude-control actuators that make contemporary highly agile spacecraft possible. The rise of commercial Earth imaging, the advances in privately built spacecraft (including small satellites), and the growing popularity of the subject matter in academic circles over the past decade argues that now is the time for an in-depth treatment of the topic. CMGs are augmented by reaction wheels and related algorithms for steering all such actuators, which together comprise the field of spacecraft momentum control systems. The material is presented at a level suitable for practicing engineers and those with an undergraduate degree in mechanical, electrical, and/or aerospace engineering.},

@article{Huang2016,
abstract = {A new variable speed control moment gyro (VSCMG) steering law is proposed in order to achieve higher torque precision. The dynamics of VSCMGs is established, and two work modes are then designed according to command torque: control momentum gyro (CMG)/reaction wheel (RW) hybrid mode for the large torque case and RW single mode for the small. When working in the CMG/RW hybrid mode, the steering law deals with the gimbal dead-zone nonlinearity through compensation by RW sub-mode. This is in contrast to the conventional CMG singularity avoidance and wheel speed equalization, as well as the proof of definitely hyperbolic singular property of the CMG sub-mode. When working in the RW single mode, the motion of gimbals will be locked. Both the transition from CMG/RW hybrid mode to RW single mode and the reverse are studied. During the transition, wheel speed equalization and singularity avoidance of both the CMG and RW sub-modes are considered. A steering law for the RWs with locked gimbals is presented. It is shown by simulations that the VSCMGs with this new steering law could reach a better torque precision than the normal CMGs in the case of both large and small torques.},

These CMGs with a life expectancy of approximately 10 years contain a flywheel spinning at 691 rad/s (6600 rpm) and can produce an output torque of 258 Nm (190 ft-lbf)1. One CMG unexpectedly failed after approximately 1.3 years and one developed anomalous behavior after approximately six years. Both units were returned to earth for failure investigation. This paper describes the Space Station Double Gimbal Control Moment Gyroscope design, on-orbit telemetry signatures and a summary of the results of both failure investigations. The lessons learned from these combined sources have lead to improvements in the design that will provide CMGs with greater reliability to assure the success of the Space Station. These lessons learned and design improvements are not only applicable to CMGs but can be applied to spacecraft mechanisms in general.},

@article{Liska1968,
abstract = {The extreme attitude-control precision required by the Manned Orbiting Telescope (0.01 arcsec) may only be attainable with a system using control moment gyros (CMG's). Though the CMG is dynamically nonlinear, it can, if properly utilized, generate a torque amplification of several hundred to one. This inherent “free” gain allows the size of the gimbal servos to be reduced and their linearity and precision to be increased. This paper deals with the problem of achieving torque amplification with lightweight two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) CMG's. It is shown that this can only be accomplished by mechanically (not servo-) synchronizing the gimbals of similar CMG units. The result is a heavier system than one in which two independent 2-DOF CMG's are driven to provide three-axis control, but this price is gladly paid in return for the torque gain benefits. Mechanical synchronization also gives the 2-DOF CMG the same passive stabilization characteristics as the 1-DOF CMG. To improve matters even further, a new “coning”-type gimbal suspension is described which greatly simplifies gimbal synchronization and simultaneously eliminates the unwanted control torque cross-coupling inherent in the conventional 2-DOF CMG gimbal suspension. The gimbal and vehicle equations of motion are derived for both systems and an experimental coning suspension CMG is described which uses very low friction components in laboratory tests of high-accuracy control. {\textcopyright} 1968 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.},

abstract = "This paper presents a technique for CMG-based attitude control of spacecraft that does not require calculating the pseudo-inverse of the CMG Jacobian matrix. In order to obtain a steering law, the transpose of the Jacobian matrix is used rather than its pseudo-inverse. The transpose-based method alleviates some of the problems inherent in the existing steering laws that use the pseudo-inverse, such as high gimbal rates near singularities. The proposed method provides viable rates for the CMGs even when the gimbals pass through a singular configuration. The validity of the steering law is demonstrated using Liapunov's stability theorem, and it is shown that the method provides superior results when compared with conventional steering laws that use the pseudo-inverse of the CMG Jacobian Matrix. In addition, the redundant feature of the 4-gimbal CMG system is exploited to force the gimbals to attain certain specified angles while the spacecraft's attitude is being controlled. This is done by adding appropriate null motion to the CMGs. The specified angles for the gimbals can be arbitrary as long as their net momentum is consistent with the requirements of the spacecraft."

abstract = {Control laws for an integrated power/attitude control system (IPACS) for a satellite using variable-speed single-gimbal control moment gyroscopes (VSCMGs) are introduced. Whereas the wheel spin rates of the conventional CMGs are constant, the VSCMGs are allowed to have variable speeds. Therefore, VSCMGs have extra degrees of freedom and can be used to achieve additional objectives, such as energy storage, as well as attitude control. We use VSCMGs in conjunction with an IPACS system. The gimbal rates of the VSCMGs are used to provide the reference-tracking torques, whereas the wheel accelerations are used for both attitude and power reference tracking. The latter objective is achieved by storing or releasing the kinetic energy in the wheels. The control algorithms perform both the attitude and power tracking goals simultaneously. A model-based control and an indirect adaptive control for a spacecraft with uncertain inertia properties are developed. Moreover, control laws for equalization of the wheel speeds are also proposed. Wheel speed equalization distributes evenly the kinetic energy among the wheels, minimizing the possibility of wheel speed saturation and the occurrence of zero-speed singularities. Finally, a numerical example for a satellite in a low Earth, near-polar orbit is provided to test the proposed IPACS algorithm.},

The innovation of the result is the development of a Lyapunov-based design/analysis that indicates exponential convergence to an arbitrarily small domain. The result is obtained despite the characteristics of the uncertainty; the nonvanishing disturbance terms; and the fact that the control input is premultiplied by a non-square, time-varying, nonlinear, uncertain matrix.

@article{Gui2015,
abstract = {The attitude control of a rigid spacecraft with two skew single-gimbal control moment gyros (CMGs), which is subject to an underactuated nonholonomic constraint, is investigated. Nonlinear control theory is used to show that the combined dynamics of the spacecraft-CMG system are small-time locally controllable (STLC) from and feedback stabilizable to any equilibrium where two CMGs never encounter certain special configurations. Specially, the attitude stabilization issue is approached under the restriction that the total angular momentum of the spacecraft-CMG system is zero, which not only guarantees that the feasible equilibrium attitude can be any orientation but also renders STLC for these attitudes. In order to overcome the troublesome singular problem of two skew CMGs, a nonlinear approximation of the full attitude equations is derived for control law design by assuming that the spacecraft angular velocity is small. A novel singular quaternion stabilization law is then proposed to stabilize the spacecraft attitude with bounded angular velocities, which in turn ensures the satisfaction of the small angular velocity assumption during the entire control process. Numerical examples and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control method in stabilizing the full spacecraft-CMG system.},

abstract = {A miniaturized attitude control system suitable for nanosatellites, developed using only commercial off-the-shelf components, is described in the paper. It is a complete and independent system to be used on board nanosatellites, allowing automated attitude control. To integrate this system into nanosatellites such as Cubesats its size has been reduced down to a cube of side about 5 cm. The result is a low cost attitude control system built with terrestrial components, integrating three micro magnetotorquers, three micro reaction wheels, three magnetometers and redundant control electronics, capable of performing automatics operations on request from the ground. The system can operate as a real time maneuvering system, executing commands sent from the ground or as a standalone attitude control system receiving the solar array status from a hosting satellite and the satellite ephemeris transmitted from the ground station. The main characteristics of the developed system and test results are depicted in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = { A recently emerged driving requirement for microsatellites is a precise and fast attitude maneuvering capability. Agility enhances the operational efficiency of missions requiring a high level of retargeting ability, such as space station and satellite on-orbit servicing, formation flying, Earth monitoring, and space-based space debris observation and tracking. Three-axis stabilized microsatellites are mainly equipped with momentum wheels, barely meeting agility requirements. In this paper, the design and manufacturing of a cluster of four single-gimbal variable-speed control-moment gyros (SGCMGs), suitable for attitude control with high-agility capability of a 10–30\&nbsp;kg class microsatellite, is presented. The flywheel design is based on a brushless motor out-runner configuration, in which the motor magnets, embedded in the rotor, provide for the wheel inertia. This configuration has the advantage of providing a high inertia while minimizing cogging torque at low speed. The elimination of the wheel dummy mass provides a significant improvement in the system mass efficiency. In addition, this configuration allows using commercial off-the-shelf parts, eliminating the wheel-balancing procedure with evident jitter limitation and economic and development time benefits. A relevant feature is the electronics architecture based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated circuit, chosen to improve power efficiency and provide a high level of reliability for the system. This can be assured by proper time and space redundancy for each low-level logic block of the design. The system performance in terms of provided torque and power consumption has been experimentally measured by using a ground-testing prototype mounted on a test bed, and the results are reported. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed actuator as an efficient solution for the attitude control of microsatellites, in terms of mass, volume, and power constraints. }

abstract = {The pyramidal reaction wheel arrangement is one of the configurations that can be used in attitude control simulators for evaluation of attitude control performance in satellites. In this arrangement, the wheels are oriented in a pyramidal configuration with a tilt angle. In this paper, a study of pyramidal reaction wheel arrangement is carried out in order to find the optimum tilt angle that minimizes total power consumption of the system. The attitude control system is analyzed and the pyramidal configuration is implemented in numerical simulation. Optimization is carried out by using an iterative process and the optimum tilt angle that provides minimum system power consumption is obtained. Simulation results show that the system requires the least power by using optimum tilt angle in reaction wheels arrangement. {\textcopyright} The Korean Society for Aeronautical {\&} Space Sciences.},
